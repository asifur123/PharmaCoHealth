# PharmaCoHealth
PharmaCoHealth is an interactive and user-friendly software that will be used for managing patient and doctor records and information. As the number of patients are increasing, many of the hospitals in Bangladesh requires software that can store and manage information of both doctor and patient. In this project I have implemented SQL queries like - SELECT, JOIN, INNER JOIN, UPDATE, COUNT, Subquery to Search patients information, patients report, total number of patients, appointment with doctors.
